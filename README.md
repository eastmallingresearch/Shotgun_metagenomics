## Assembly
metaspades and megahit are two decent options  
Current version of MetaSPAdes can only assemble a single sample - pity as it produces slightly better assemblies than megahit.  
Megahit uses a lot less (~1/4) memory than MetaSPAdes

### Binning

#### Functional bins

#### Genomic bins

##### Taxonomy assignment
